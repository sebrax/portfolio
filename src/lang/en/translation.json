    "about_description": "<p>I’m Sulivan, a self-taught web developer from São Paulo, Brazil, 30 years old, with over 13 years of hands-on experience in technology. My first contact with programming was at the age of 8, exploring the BASIC language to create games. By 11, I was diving into Adobe Flash, Photoshop, and Illustrator, creating animations and experimenting with ActionScript, which resulted in my first mini-game.</p><p>After a period working in IT support and infrastructure, I returned to programming in 2015, specializing in PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Since then, I’ve been developing complete web systems, landing pages, and e-commerce platforms.</p><p>Currently, I manage two SaaS systems:</p><ul><li><strong>Dispatcher System</strong>: A backoffice platform for client management, built with Laravel + Vue.js.</li><li><strong>Multi-user Business Control System</strong>: Includes features like cash flow management, purchase records, and detailed transaction reports.</li></ul><p>I also manage notable projects such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Me Too Brazil Portal</strong>: A platform for an internationally recognized NGO focused on protecting women and children from abuse.</li><li><strong>Tuzzy E-Sports Portal and E-Commerce</strong>: An emerging e-sports team competing in international EAFC and Pokémon Unite championships.</li></ul><p>For more details and projects, visit the \"Projects\" section of my portfolio.</p>",
